          The aim of this course is to teach the foundations of functional programming and how to apply them in the real world.
          This course will be taught by <strong>Erik Meijer</strong>.  He is perhaps best known for his contributions
          to programming languages such as Haskell, C#, Visual Basic, and Hack, and his work on LINQ and the Rx
          Framework. You can find this course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/delftx/delftx-fp101x-introduction-functional-2126">here.</a>

          <h3>About the course</h3>
          <p>Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.</p>
          <p>Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.</p>

          <p>This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.</p>
          <p>Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example.</p>
